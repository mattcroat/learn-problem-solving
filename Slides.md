### Do you feel stuck? 😫

-   🧑‍🔬 You tried every course and tutorial
-   😢 You can't make anything on your own
-   😔 You feel lost
-   💊 There's a cure

---

### ...

**Problem solving and critical thinking is a skill you have to practice outside coding.**

### 1. Think About The Problem

-   ❓️ Everything is a problem
-   🧑‍🎨 Don't stare at a blank canvas
-   🤔 Stop and think about the requirements
-   ✏️ Sketch your idea using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)

---

### Todo App Sketch

---

### Todo App Requirements

-   Enter and submit a todo item
-   Mark a todo item as completed
-   Edit the todo item
-   Remove a todo item
-   Show how many uncompleted todo items are left
-   Filter todo items by ALL, ACTIVE, COMPLETED
-   Clear completed todo items

---

### ...

**Requirements give you a clear goal and bring up questions and show potential problems.**

---

### ...

**Questions move your forward to a solution.**

---

### ...

**Your projects fail because there's no scope and you abandon it after you get bored or the level of complexity explodes.**

---

### 2. Break Down The Problem

-   😫 Don't just look at the finished product
-   ⚛️ Break down the problem into atoms
-   🤯 Every project starts with one line of code
-   🧁 Ignore window dressing

---

**How do you know if you know enough JavaScript to get started working on projects?**

---

### ...

**After you learn the fundamentals of JavaScript you’re going to learn the answer through working on projects because it’s going to show the holes in your knowledge.**

---

### ...

**You can spend years learning about one thing — this is the trap of learning for sake of learning.**

**Avoid it because you’re going to be more excited to learn about something when you understand how it can help you solve a problem.**

**Learning is a marathon and not a race and it’s not done once you finish a course.**

---

### ...

**Break down the problem you’re trying to solve into smaller problems and avoid the ones that scare you.**

### 3. Get Your Hands Dirty

-   😪 Don't pasively consume content
-   🧑‍🏭 You have to get your hands dirty
-   😅 Feeling uncomfortable means you're learning
-   💪 Develop muscle memory
-   🧠 Develop pattern recognition

---

### ...

**Repetition is everything.**

---

### ...

**If you don’t understand something start from scratch and repeat doing it because you’re going to be less overwhelmed by syntax and can focus on the logic.**

---

### ...

**Trying to learn syntax and logic at the same time is equivalent of learning how to play the guitar and sing at the same time.**

---

### ...

**Five minutes of practice is better than trying to make up for everything on the weekend and get crushed trying to learn everything at once.**

---

### ...

**You’re going to feel frustrated when you move at a snail’s pace but you’re going to learn and grow faster than farming tutorials because you’re exercising your brain just like going to the gym.**

---

### ...

**As you learn and improve at your craft you’re going to start recognizing patterns and be able to learn things quicker because of your past experience.**

**You’re never going to know everything but you’re going to have confidence you can figure it out.**

**Identify what makes you feel insecure instead of avoiding it and use repetition until it becomes second nature.**

---

### 4. Learn How Others Write Code

-   🕵️ Practice reading code
-   📖 Open source education
-   🧠 Expose yourself to ideas
-   🔥 Learn how others solve problems

---

### Tutorials Hide Reality

![Code in most tutorials](images/code-in-most-tutorials.png)

---

### Code You Might Write

![Production code](images/production-code.png)

---

### ...

**Reverse engineering and reading code is the best way to improve your craft and with practice it’s going to read like poetry.**

---

### Can you see the code?

### ...

---

### I Thought jQuery Was Magic

![jQuery](images/jquery.png)

---

### It's Not That Different

---

### ...

**It’s going to take you time and practice but nothing worth pursuing is easy.**

---

### 5. Think Using Data Structures

-   😵‍💫 Thinking about the UI is confusing
-   ⚙️ Think in data structures
-   💡 Learn how to use state
-   ♻️ Change in state drives your UI

---

### Audio Player Example

-   ▶️ Play and pause the song
-   ⏪️ Skip or rewind song
-   ⏩️ Change the song

---

### ...

**It might look like a complicated piece of machinery because it has a lot of parts like being able to load and play the audio and changing the song playing but how does that look represented in your mind?**

---

### Audio Player

![Audio player](player.webp)

---

### ...

**The audio player is just an array representing a playlist where each object represents a song.**

![Audio player](images/player.png)

---

### ...

**State is some value that represents the state of your application.**

![Audio player state](images/player-state.png)

---

### ...

**Using state you can drive the UI.**

![Audio player solution](images/player-solution.png)

---

### ...

**How does an audio player know to play a song you pressed play on?**

---

### ...

**Write the static HTML first and go backwards and make it dynamic after you understand the solution.**

![Song select](images/song-select.png)

---

### ...

**Isolate the problem so you don’t have to think about the moving parts and focus on solving one problem at a time — reproducing a problem like this lets you share it with others when asking for help.**

---

### 6. Learn Data Manipulation

-   🕔️ 99% of what you do
-   👷 Take some API and build a UI around it
-   💪 Learn manipulating Arrays and Objects
-   🔥 Learn `map`, `filter` and `...spread`

---

### Spread

![Data manipulation](images/manipulating-data.png)

---

### ...

**Solving coding puzzles doesn’t reflect your ability as a developer, so don’t waste your time and work on projects instead.**

---

### Use the PokeAPI

**Loop over the list of Pokemon and show the information for each one inside a card.**

![Pokemon API](images/pokemon-api.png)

---

### 7. Learn CRUD Operations

-   🤔 Everything is a CRUD app
-   🤖 Create, read, update, delete
-   🦴 Backbone of everything
-   🧘 Use local storage or a database

---

### Project Ideas

-   ✍️ Content management system
-   📚️ Bookshelf app
-   📺️ Keep track of TV shows and movies
-   🏋️ Exercise app

---

### ...

**If what you’re doing solves a problem you have it’s going to be way more engaging and get you hooked into learning.**

---

### 8. Read Documentation

-   😔 Bad documentation gives it a bad reputation
-   📖 Great documentation should be engaging and have a lot of examples
-   🗓️ Documentation is always up to date
-   🥰 Videos and reading documentation complement each other

---

### MDN Documentation

-   Explains the parameters
-   Teach you when to use `map` over `forEach` or `for...of`
-   Shows you examples

![MDN documentation](images/mdn-array.png)

---

### ...

**If you find reading MDN hard to grok you can find a more friendlier version on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp).**

**Another fantastic documentation resource for JavaScript is [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/) that you can always use as reference.**

---

### ...

**Don’t fall into the trap of having to learn everything because only doing is going to give you experience.**

---

### 9. Question Everything

-   ⚡️ Asking questions is the fastest way to improve
-   🤗 You're not alone
-   🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Join a [Discord](https://discord.com/) or [Slack](https://slack.com/) community
-   🧑‍🏫 Never feel bad about asking questions

---

### Ask Questions

![React](images/react.png)

---

### ...

**Take advantage of social media and places where developers aggregate like Twitter and start following smart people which is like having a mentor — you can peak into the mind of great developers and ask questions or learn useful tips and tricks and stay up to date.**

---

### 10. Write About What You Learn

-   ✍️ Journal or write a blog post
-   👨‍💼 Build authority and expertise
-   🤔 Put your thoughts on paper
-   🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Use [DEV Community](https://dev.to/) or [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/)

---

### Writing Tips

-   😒 Don't try to be smart
-   ✍️ Start by creating an outline
-   🧠 Dump your brain on the page
-   🤔 Format later
-   🍲 Leave it for a day
-   😄 Use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)

### ...

**Regardless what method you use I hope you learned more about problem solving and are able to use it in your next project.**
